# Introduction
This repository contains example project made as illustration for handling a gun held in the player hands in FPP-like games.
The project is meant as supplemental to the presentation available [here](https://piotr.kosek.com/presentations/gun.ppsx).
The presentation is included here as well, at the final commit.

# Unity Version
The project was tested at 2021.3.44f1(LTS) on built-in renderer.
It should work on any of the LTS versions.
URP/HDRP will require material conversion. Unity 6 was not tested.
